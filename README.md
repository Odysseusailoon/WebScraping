# WebScraping
Use web scraping to solve practical problems I face.

Deal with login, cookie, re-captcha, md5, etc.

In `graspcourse.py`, I use PriorityQueue to represent my preference on courses and host my program on aws server to help me grasp what I want.

In `grasptoefl.py', I use my program to check avaible seats to prevent me from travelling to another province to take the exam.
